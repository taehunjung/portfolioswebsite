                    <h3>Design + Development</h3>
                    <p>I've always been passionate about finding discomforts in life so as a software engineer we can solve that issues for everyone. 
                    One of the things that I recently came across as discomfort is not being provided with enough info about course evaluations at the university I'm studying. 
                    So while I was in 21 days travel quarantine, I designed and developed a website where students can share their course evaluations. 
                    I am yet to receive feedbacks from students since classes haven't started yet but I am optimistic about the website. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Product Management</h3>
                    <p>
                    On top of being a front-end developer, I am confident that I can lead a team and come up with a product that can satisfy my clients' needs. 
                    This summer, after getting discharged from the army, I was given an opportunity to form a team and start working on an app that is based on 
                    photography and music. Although it's yet to be finished, I am optimistic about how this product will turn out when it's done.

            <div class="about-me__body">
                <p>I am a U3 computer science student at McGill University. I have served in the Korean Army from September 2019 to April 2021. 
                I can say with pride & confidence that my service in the military help me develop perseverance, which I lacked in prior to my service. 
                With my experience in the army, I think I am ready to dive into a project in developing mobile apps and websites depending on the clients' needs.  
                </p>
                <p>
                It's true that it hasn't been too long since I got into front-end development, but I am confident that I can pick up any programming language quickly. 
                An example that showcases that is my website called "RatemyCourses". It's a website I've worked on for the first time in html, php and css while I was in 21 days of quarantine. 
                I was able to work on the front & back-end all by myself through learning everything from YouTube and Google.
